As visible in the MATLAB report, the outputs match expectations.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Ideal, D = 40} - Ringing effects are clearly visible due to low cutoff frequency. Image is not very clear as several crucial elements have been removed from the Fourier Transform.
\item \textbf{Ideal, D = 80} - Some amount of ringing is seen, but it's lesser than $D=40$. This is because side-lobes get significantly smaller as $D$ increases. Image is a lot clearer too.
\item \textbf{Gaussian, S = 40} - Ringing absent, image seems to have undergone right amount of blur.
\item \textbf{Gaussian, S = 80} - Ringing absent, image is sharper than $S = 40$ since more high frequency components are preserved.
\end{itemize}
